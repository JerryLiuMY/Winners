INFER.R IMPLEMENTS THE INFERENCE ON WINNERS METHODOLOGY OF ANDREWS, KITAGAWA AND MCCLOSKEY.
THE CODE IS WRITTEN AS A SCRIPT RATHER THAN AS A FUNCTION FOR PRACTICAL REASONS. 
IT MAY, THEREFORE, OVERWRITE SIMILARLY NAMED OBJECTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

THE CODE HAS BEEN TESTED ON A WINDOWS OS PC RUNNING RSTUDIO 1.3.959 AND R 4.0.2.
SOME PACKAGES MUST BE PRE-LOADED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT (CODE TESTED FOR VERSIONS OF PACKAGES IN PARENTHESES):
    matrixcalc (1.0-3),
    matrixStats (0.56.0), AND
    TruncatedNormal (2.2).
NOTE: SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE MASKED FROM OTHER PACKAGES UPON LOADING.

USER INPUT IS SPECIFIED ON LINES 31-50 OF THE CODE.
    X       CLASS: NUMERIC VECTOR. 
            A K-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR CONTAINING THE ESTIMATES OF THE OUTPUT VARIABLE IN EACH OF THE K TREATMENT ARMS.
    SIGMA   CLASS: NUMERIC MATRIX.  
            A K X K-DIMENSIONAL SEMI-POSITIVE DEFINITE MATRIX CONTAINING THE ESTIMATES OF THE COVARIANCES OF THE TREATMENT ARMS.
    NDRAWS  CLASS: INTEGER.
            THE NUMBER OF SIMULATIONS TO USE TO COMPUTE THE TRUNCATED NORMAL PROBABILITIES.
    ALPHA   CLASS: NUMERIC.
            THE SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL OF THE TEST IN (0,1).
    BETA    CLASS: NUMERIC.
            CORRECTION FOR THE HYBRID METHODS.
THE LAST THREE USER INPUTS HAVE DEFAULT VALUES ATTACHED AND CAN BE LEFT AS IS.
EXAMPLE VALUES OF THE FIRST TWO USER INPUTS ARE STATED. 

TO RUN, THE USER SHOULD ALTER THE USER INPUT (SEE ABOVE) TO MATCH THE STUDIED APPLICATION AND SOURCE THE SCRIPT.

THE OUTPUT IS STORED AS THE OBJECT OUTPUT.
